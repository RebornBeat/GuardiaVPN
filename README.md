Project Overview

Objective:
To provide a decentralized, private, and secure VPN solution, enabling a peer-to-peer network where users contribute bandwidth, earn credits, and enjoy high levels of privacy. GuardiaVPN does not rely on blockchain or cryptocurrency but instead uses a simple credit-based model to reward participants and promote network activity.

Key Features

1. Open-Source Code

Description: GuardiaVPN is open-source and hosted on GitHub.

Purpose: Transparency builds trust and allows community contributions to ensure no vulnerabilities or backdoors.


2. End-to-End Encryption (E2E)

Description: Data is encrypted across all nodes from the origin to the exit node.

Purpose: Guarantees data privacy and prevents tampering.


3. Multi-Hop Routing

Description: Routes traffic through multiple nodes before reaching the destination.

Purpose: Increases anonymity by hiding the connection path.


4. Decentralized Node Structure

Description: A peer-to-peer system where each device can function as a node.

Purpose: Avoids reliance on a central authority, making it censorship-resistant.


5. Credit-Based Incentive System

Description: Users earn credits for contributing bandwidth; these credits are used to access more VPN services.

Purpose: Credits incentivize participation without the need for a blockchain or cryptocurrency.


6. Traffic Obfuscation

Description: Network traffic is disguised to look like regular HTTPS traffic.

Purpose: Helps users evade detection by DPI and firewall systems.


7. Strong Encryption Protocols

Description: Utilizes AES-256 and WireGuard for secure data encryption.

Purpose: Ensures protection against data interception and eavesdropping.


8. DNS Privacy

Description: DNS queries are encrypted, using decentralized DNS for additional privacy.

Purpose: Prevents DNS leaks, enhancing user privacy.


9. Traffic Monitoring Detection and DPI Evasion

Description: Implements Deep Packet Inspection evasion techniques and randomized traffic patterns.

Purpose: Reduces the risk of traffic detection, maintaining an undetectable browsing experience.


10. Adaptive Traffic Obfuscation with AI

Description: AI dynamically modifies traffic patterns to simulate regular web activity.

Purpose: Helps evade detection by sophisticated monitoring systems.


11. Stronger User Anonymity Protections

Description: Zero-knowledge proofs allow user authentication without personal data.

Purpose: Increases user privacy by minimizing identifying data.


12. Decentralized DNS Solution

Description: Internal DNS resolution within the network, using a decentralized DNS provider.

Purpose: Ensures DNS privacy and prevents external tracking.


13. Quantum-Resistant Encryption

Description: Integrates quantum-resistant algorithms.

Purpose: Future-proofs encryption against quantum computing threats.


14. Automated Exit Node Auditing

Description: Zero-knowledge auditing verifies that exit nodes do not log data.

Purpose: Prevents malicious activities by exit nodes.


15. Inter-Node Reputation System

Description: Peer-reviewed reputation system identifies trustworthy nodes.

Purpose: Reduces risks from bad actors by rating node reliability.


16. Self-Destructing Data Packets

Description: Packets expire if not delivered within a set timeframe.

Purpose: Reduces risk in case of interception.

Credit-Based System

Earning Credits: Users earn credits by contributing bandwidth to the network, allowing their devices to act as VPN nodes.

Spending Credits: Credits are consumed when routing traffic through other nodes. The more bandwidth used, the more credits are deducted.

Reputation-Based Credit Boost: Reliable, high-quality nodes receive credits at a higher rate.

Automated Credit Balancing: A system of internal algorithms balances credit distribution, preventing abuse and ensuring fair distribution among all contributors.

Use Cases

1. Privacy for Journalists and Activists: Secure, difficult-to-trace communications for individuals in restrictive environments.


2. General Privacy-Conscious Users: Enhanced anonymity for daily internet browsing, protecting user privacy.




---

Technical Implementation

1. Peer-to-Peer Node Discovery: Uses Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) to discover nodes in a decentralized manner.


2. Data Encryption: End-to-end encryption via WireGuard with multi-hop support.


3. Reputation and Credit System: Tracks node performance and distributes credits without personal data.


4. Traffic Obfuscation and DPI Evasion: AI-driven obfuscation to evade monitoring.


5. DNS Privacy: Integrates a decentralized DNS solution, routing DNS queries within the VPN.


6. Self-Destructing Packets: Adds expiration times to packets for enhanced security.
